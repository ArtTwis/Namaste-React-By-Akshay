The command npm is used to download JavaScript packages from Node Package Manager, and npx is used to execute JavaScript packages downloaded this way.



This command will download the NPM package create-react-app to a subdirectory of the current working directory named node_modules:
npm install create-react-app


This command will execute the NPM package create-react-app with the name argument myreactapp, creating a bare-bones React app in the subdirectory myreactapp:
npx create-react-app myreactapp




Without npx:
npm install create-react-app
node ./node_modules/create-react-app/index.js myreactapp

With npx:
npx create-react-app myreactapp
