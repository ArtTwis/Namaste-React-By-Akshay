We can't make useEffect callback function async because React's useEffect hook expects a cleanup function returned from it which is called when the component unmounts. Using an async function here will cause a bug as the cleanup function will never get called.

But in class based component we have another method which is called after unmounting the component ie. componentWillUnmount(). That's why we can make async to componentDidMount but not to callback function inside useEffect.
