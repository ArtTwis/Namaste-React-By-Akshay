Why React is fast because it uses Virtual DOM.

Virtual DOM is representation of your actual DOM.

It uses Reconscilation : The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.

It'll only re-render only the things which will findout by diff algorithm.

Later in React 16 Diff algorithm is replaced by React Fibre.

React Fibre is a new Reconscilation Engine.


Ways to make react app render fats :-
- Whenever we uses .map() and iterate to render component always use key property in it and that key should be unique for each element.
