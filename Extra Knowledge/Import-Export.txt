export function MyComponent() {}
vs
export default MyComponent;


Exports without a default tag are Named exports and Exports with the default tag are Default exports.




// Named Export :- As the title suggests, named exports use the name of the function or class as their identifier.

export const MyFunction = () => {
  ...body
}

// or

export function MyFunction() {
  ...body
}


When you want to import a named component, you use the same name it was exported with. Names must be imported inside curly brackets.

import { MyComponent } from "./my-component"
import { MyComponent as MyComponentAlias } from "./my-component"


Module exports per File....

export const MyFunction1 = () => {};

export const MyFunction2 = () => {};

export const MyFunction3 = () => {};


import { MyComponent1, MyComponent2, MyComponent3 } from "./my-components"
