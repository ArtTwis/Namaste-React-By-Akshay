JSX => Syntax extension to JavaScript - Developed by Facebook Developer

It is basically a React element.

React.createElement => Object => HTML(DOM)

JSX => React.createElement => Object => HTML(DOM) 
(Babel is using React only and converting JSX syntax into React.createElement)

Advantages of JSX :-
- Readibility
- Developer Experience
- Syntactical Sugar


🔷 1. JSX
This is what you write:

const element = <h1>Hello, Twinkle!</h1>;
But remember: Browsers don’t understand JSX — it’s syntactic sugar for easier UI writing.

🔷 2. ↓ (Babel) – JSX → JavaScript
Babel is a compiler that converts JSX into standard JavaScript code.

After Babel transpiles it, this becomes:

const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, Twinkle!');
So you can think of JSX as a developer-friendly shortcut that Babel converts into actual function calls.

🔷 3. React.createElement() → React Element (Virtual DOM Node)
React.createElement() doesn’t create a real DOM element. It returns a plain JavaScript object that represents a UI element.

Example output:

{
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    children: 'Hello, Twinkle!'
  }
}
👉 This is what we call a React Element, and it lives in the Virtual DOM.

🔷 4. React Element → React Reconciler
Here’s where React’s internal engine (called the Reconciler) kicks in.

It compares the current React Element tree to the previous one (using diffing).
Figures out what actually changed.
Prepares the most efficient set of changes (patches) to apply to the real DOM.
This diffing + decision-making process is called Reconciliation.

🔷 5. React Reconciler → React DOM (Actual DOM operations)
Once React knows what to change, it hands over the job to React DOM, which interacts with the real browser DOM.

React DOM uses functions like:

document.createElement()
element.setAttribute()
parent.appendChild()
to manipulate the browser’s DOM based on what changed.

🔷 6. React DOM → Actual DOM Displayed on Screen
Finally, your JSX gets translated → optimized → rendered → and ends up visible on the screen in your browser.

🔁 Bonus: On State Updates
Every time state/props change:

React creates a new Virtual DOM
It compares (diffs) it with the previous one
Applies minimal changes to the real DOM
This makes React super fast and efficient, since the browser DOM is slow to update directly.

📌 Summary Visualization:

 ↓   (Babel compiles)
React.createElement()

React Element (Virtual DOM)
 ↓   (Reconciler compares old vs new)

 ↓   (Minimal DOM operations)
React DOM
 ↓
Visible DOM on screen
