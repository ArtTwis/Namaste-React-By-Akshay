When you pass Data / State from parent to child components and then to other child is known as prop drilling.

for example :- 
- AppLayout
    {state=user}
    - <Body user={user} />
            - <RestaurentCard user={user} />
                - <h4>{user}</h4>

====================== Prop Drilling ========================

Why do we use useContext ? 
- To avoid prop drilling.
